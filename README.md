# PyCodeView
PyCodeView is a Python code viewing tool inspired by the functionality of SmallTalk IDE. With PyCodeView, users can seamlessly navigate through Python codebases, narrowing their focus to specific files, classes, and functions. This tool proves invaluable when dealing with extensive codebases, allowing users to cut through clutter and concentrate on areas of interest.

Utilizing Python's AST module, PyCodeView generates lists of source files, classes, and functions in a Listview, which can be clicked to only focus on relevant code. Additionally, PyCodeView features syntax highlighting, enhancing code readability and comprehension.

It uses Python-QT for graphical user interface (GUI).

## How to use (for linux):
1. Download release binary
2. Put in your PATH
3. Run `pycodeview src_root_folder`
